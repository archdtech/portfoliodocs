- Measure: User feedback and retention, not vanity metrics
- Budget: Minimal spend on targeted experiments

### **2. Customer-Led Development**
- Talk to users daily during MVP phase
- Iterate based on real user feedback
- Build what users actually need, not what you think they need

### **3. Rapid Experimentation**
- Test multiple acquisition channels simultaneously
- Kill what doesn't work quickly
- Double down on what shows promise

### **4. Realistic Expectations**
- Most MVPs will fail or need significant pivots
- Success is learning, not immediate revenue
- Focus on finding product-market fit above all else

### **Immediate Actions (This Week)**
1. **Choose 2 projects** to focus on first (recommend cardsandstarts + vps-docker)
